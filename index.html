        <h1>Project on console</h1>
        <p>Visual studio is an IDE (Integrated Developing Environment). VSC is used for coding. You can set it up by downloading it. (???)</p>
        <p>Console screen is a screen where the console is displayed. It is used to show something. You can open console by Right-Clicking anywhere on the page. A list of options will appear, and you have to click on the option that says "Inspect". After clicking on Inspect, there will be a bar on the left side of the screen. On the top of the bar, there will be options. You will see that you will be starting on the Elements Screen. Clicking on the console will make the console screen open. You can print anything on the console by storing a variable with any thing in it and then using console.log code to show it.
        </p>
